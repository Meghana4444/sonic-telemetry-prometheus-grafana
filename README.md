Abstract

Modern data centers and cloud networks require continuous visibility into network performance to ensure reliability, scalability, and low latency. Traditional monitoring techniques are reactive and fail to provide real-time insights.

This project presents a real-time telemetry monitoring system inspired by SONiC, using a lightweight Python exporter to expose network interface metrics. These metrics are collected by Prometheus and visualized through Grafana dashboards, enabling proactive monitoring and faster decision-making.

The solution demonstrates an industry-grade, cloud-native telemetry pipeline in a simplified and extensible form, making it suitable for education, rapid prototyping, and future large-scale deployment
